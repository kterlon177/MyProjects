    <h1 class="display-3">Syria</h1>
    <p class="lead">Syria, country located on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea in southwestern Asia. Its area includes territory in the Golan Heights that has been occupied by Israel since 1967. The present area does not coincide with ancient Syria, which was the strip of fertile land lying between the eastern Mediterranean coast and the desert of northern Arabia. The capital is Damascus (Dimashq), on the Baradā River, situated in an oasis at the foot of Mount Qāsiyūn.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">After Syria gained its independence in 1946, political life in the country was highly unstable, owing in large measure to intense friction between the country’s social, religious, and political groups. In 1970 Syria came under the authoritarian rule of Pres. Hafiz al-Assad, whose foremost goals included achieving national security and domestic stability and recovering the Syrian territory lost to Israel in 1967. Assad committed his country to an enormous arms buildup, which put severe strains on the national budget, leaving little for development. After Assad’s death in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad became president. Despite some early steps toward political reform, Bashar al-Assad ultimately continued his father’s authoritarian style of government, using Syria’s powerful military and security services to quash political dissent. Long-suppressed internal tensions led to the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011.

    <h1 class="display-4">Demographics of Syria</h1>
    <p class="lead">Syria's estimated population is about 22 ±.5[1] million (pre–Syrian Civil War 2011) permanent inhabitants, which include 21,124,000 Syrians [2], Iraqi refugees[3], Palestinian refugees,[3] and those from Somalia.[3] The war makes an accurate count of the Syrian population difficult, as the numbers of Syrian refugees[4], internally displaced Syrians and casualty numbers are in flux. The CIA World Factbook showed an estimated 19,454,263 people as of July 2018.[5]
    </p>
    <p class="lead">While most modern-day Syrians are commonly described as Arabs by virtue of their modern-day language and bonds to Arab culture and history, they are, in fact, largely a blend of the various Semitic-speaking groups indigenous to the region.</p>

    <p class="lead">Since 1960, censuses have been conducted in 1960, 1970, 1981, 1994 and 2004.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 2014, 17,951,639, a massive decline due to nearly 4 million Syrian refugees leaving the country because of the Syrian Civil War and furthermore because of the death in the war. This is a drop of 9.7% from the previous year.</p>
    <p class="lead">In 2017, the head of the Syrian Commission for Family Affairs, Mohammad Akram al-Qash, said that the Syrian population was 28 million, of which, 21 million were living in Syria and that 7 million were refugees.</p>
